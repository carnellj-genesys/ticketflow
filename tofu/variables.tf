/*
 * Terraform Variables Configuration for TicketFlow
 * 
 * This file is intended to define input variables for the TicketFlow Terraform
 * configuration. Currently empty, but could include variables such as:
 * 
 * - Environment-specific configuration values
 * - Resource naming conventions
 * - Feature flags for conditional resource creation
 * - External service endpoints
 * - Authentication credentials (though these are currently defined in integrations.tf)
 * 
 * Variables defined here would be used across other Terraform files to make
 * the configuration more flexible and reusable across different environments.
